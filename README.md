# 🛍️ Market Analysis Report for a National Clothing Chain

> *"I always wondered — what if we could predict what each customer really wants, even without knowing their income?"*

Faced with stagnant sales, a national clothing retailer needed actionable insights to optimize their marketing strategy. This project aimed to analyze various data sources — including census data, customer behavior, and product performance — to determine **which product to advertise to each customer**, in order to **maximize engagement and profitability**.

## 📦 Dataset Overview

This project combines multiple sources of data:
- **Customer Data**: Demographics, location, and purchase history
- **Product Data**: Inventory, prices, ratings, and return rates
- **Census Data**: Average income, population, industry per location
- **Additional Data**: Weather, economy, and local competition

Using these datasets, the analysis estimates customer income, identifies patterns in purchase behavior, and correlates product performance with satisfaction indicators.

## ❓ Key Business Questions

1. 📈 What is the correlation between **sales** and **income**?
2. 💬 How are **customer ratings** linked to **product return rates**?
3. 🔍 Can we **predict income** based on **sales behavior** and **location**?
4. 👤 Which customer is predicted to have the **highest income**?
5. 👜 Which product should be advertised the most?
